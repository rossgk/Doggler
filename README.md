# Doggler Project Overview
### Readme file

*Doggler* is a basic Arduino-compatible device with the primary goal of logging temperature measurements to a mini SDRAM card for graphing or further analysis.

Now the maker world is awash in datalogger projects, though they will often include a real-time clock (RTC) and network connectivity. Those are useful functions in some situations, however in many cases, one knows the setup and end-of-test timing, and is perfectly happy with data logged onto removable media. Thus there seemed an opportunity to keep costs low by avoiding RTC and network-interface hardware.  This also makes it easier for programming in a tight memory footprint.

Documentation is provided here to orient a new user to the project and outline the basic control and usage of the device. Experienced Arduino programmers can delve into the inner workings and change behaviour or develop their own experiemental projects on the hardware.
